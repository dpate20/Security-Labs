# Security-Labs
Welcome to my **Security Labs** repository — a growing collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs and write-ups.

This repo uses a simple **PDF-first** structure: every lab is stored as a **PDF report** inside `reports/`.  
No extra artifacts folders — just clean, easy-to-browse documentation.

✅ **Ethics & authorization:** All work is performed in **controlled, authorized lab environments** (systems I own or have explicit permission to test).  
🚫 No production targets. No public scanning. No unauthorized activity.
